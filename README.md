# ðŸ“¡ MiniTalk

**MiniTalk** is a simple client-server messaging system using only **UNIX signals**.  
This 42 project demonstrates inter-process communication using low-level signaling (`SIGUSR1`, `SIGUSR2`) to transmit strings from one process (client) to another (server) **bit by bit**.

## ðŸ§© About

> MiniTalk is a proof-of-concept to show how signals (`SIGUSR1` and `SIGUSR2`) can be used for **bit-level communication** between 2 processes.

You write a **server** that listens for signals and a **client** that sends characters bit by bit.

No pipes, no sockets â€” just signals and patience. ðŸ˜„
